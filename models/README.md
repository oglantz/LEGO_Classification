# Models Directory

This directory contains model weights and checkpoints.

## Structure

- `segmentation/` - FastSAM model weights (downloaded automatically)
- `classification/` - Trained ResNet50 checkpoints (created during training)

## Gitignore

Model weights are excluded from git to keep the repository size manageable. They will be downloaded automatically when needed.
